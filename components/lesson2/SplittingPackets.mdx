Now that we know how MTU works, let's assume that the MTU size in our virtual network is 65 kilobytes.
It will make it easier to deal with larger files for the purposes of this lesson.

Now you can paint a postcard you want to send to your friend:

<PostcardSketch />

If we look under the hood of this image file, we'll discover that it's just a sequence of bytes. There are
different ways to encode images as data, but in this case we can assume that it's a _bitmap_, which means
that every <abbr title="picture element, a single dot">pixel</abbr> is encoded with 4 component numbers,
denoting the color intensity of red, green, blue, and alpha (which is used for opacity).

<ColorCoding />

This image is 300 x 300 pixels in size, and each pixel is encoded with 4 bytes. This means that the entire
image will be of 300 x 300 x 4 = 360,000 bytes in size, or about 351 kilobytes. It should fit into 4 network packets.

Since the image is a sequence of bytes, we can put them into an array and work with it just as with any other
array of numbers. For example, let's see what will happen if we preserve only the red component of the image:

The same idea applies to _splitting_ the image into smaller parts. Rust has a powerful toolkit to work with arrays and sequences,
[_iterators_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/index.html). With iterators, you can transform sequences
of numbers in different ways&mdash;split them, create new sequences out of existing ones, combine them and calculate a single result
(for example, summing them), etc. For our case of splitting an image into small parts, there's a function called [`slice::chunks`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.slice.html#method.chunks).

Let's see how it works:

<ChunksPlayground />

Now you can see how with a simple function call we can construct a series of packets with the size we need.

Let's see how this works within our virtual network&mdash;we already know that Alice expects us to send her
the 300 x 300 image file, so let's do that, using the familiar methods from the first lesson:
