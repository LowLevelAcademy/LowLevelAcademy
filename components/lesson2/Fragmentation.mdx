In <a href="/tcp-ip-fundamentals/exchanging-messages">the first lesson</a>, we found the IP address of your friend Alice and we had a nice chat.
But now she asks you to send her a postcard as an image file, and you have been trying to do that—unsuccessfully.
Turns out, you can't send a large file in a single network packet!

Let's see why exactly this happens and devise a solution to overcome this limitation, learning how to successfully deliver
your picture. After completing this lesson, you’ll learn how to split
large messages into smaller packets using Rust iterators and how to deal with out-of-order delivery.

Let's suppose that this image is of 260 kilobytes in size. As we learned in the previous lesson, a single IP packet fits 65 kilobytes of data.
In real networks, though, this number is even smaller as it is limited by the constraints of the physical Ethernet or Wi-Fi networks.
We call this limit the _Maximum transmission unit_ size, or MTU for short. _MTU_ depends on the physical network configuration, and in
the majority of [Ethernet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet) or Wi-Fi-based networks it sits at _1500_ bytes.
In practice, this means that most IP packets are smaller than 1.5 kilobytes.

What happens if we have an MTU of 1500 but send an IP packet of 65 kilobytes in size?

To find out, let's get back to the table deconstruction of an IP packet:

<table
  className="ip-packet-vis"
  style={{ width: "75%", marginBottom: "30px", marginTop: "20px" }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="2">
        <a title="column size in bits">0</a>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="2" className="text-right">
        <a title="column size in bits">15</a>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="2">
        <a title="column size in bits">16</a>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="2" className="text-right">
        <a title="column size in bits">31</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Version</td>
      <td>Header length</td>
      <td colSpan="2">Type of Service</td>
      <td colSpan="4">Total length</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="4" className={styles.tableIdentification}>
        Identification
      </td>
      <td className={styles.tableFlags}>Flags</td>
      <td colSpan="3" className={styles.tableFragmentOffset}>
        Fragment offset
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="2">Time to live (TTL)</td>
      <td colSpan="2">Protocol</td>
      <td colSpan="4">Header checksum</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="8">Source IP address</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="8">Destination IP address</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

There are three fields which are relevant to our question: <span className={styles.identification}>identification</span>, <span className={styles.flags}>flags</span>,
and the <span className={styles.fragmentOffset}>fragment offset</span>.

Because we know the MTU size in advance, we can cut IP packets into many smaller pieces called _fragments_.
Each fragment becomes its own IP packet, carrying a slice of the original message payload with its own unique <span className={styles.identification}>identification</span> number.
The <span className={styles.fragmentOffset}>offset</span> says which part of the original payload this fragment carries.
This information allows the receiving end to reconstruct the original packet from its fragmented form. Finally, <span className={styles.flags}>flags</span>
indicate if the IP packet is fragmented, and if it is, the final fragment will have <span className={styles.flags}>flags</span> set to zero
while the <span className={styles.fragmentOffset}>fragment offset</span> will have a non-zero value.

Let's see how a single 16 KB IP packet is split up when we adjust the MTU size:

<MtuSlider />

This kind of fragmentation happens without our knowledge. It's a part of the network stack implementation in operating systems,
so we don't have to deal with it at the IP level.

Moreover, in the real-world Internet, we will rarely experience IP fragmentation.
The reason is that IP fragmentation is fragile: for example, if one single fragment is not delivered, the original message has
to be dropped, fragmented again, and retransmitted because there's no way to retransmit only a part of it.
Instead, packets are generally made smaller than the MTU using _path MTU discovery_, where packets are made progressively smaller
until they are accepted at the destination.

And remember: we're dealing with _IP payloads_, so if we send a UDP datagram, the IP payload _will include the UDP header_.
Because of this, we can't see UDP source and destination port numbers before completely reconstructing the original message:

These limitations have led to completely disabling fragmentation in the newer Internet Protocol version (IPv6).
Naturally, you ask: why are we even talking about it then? It's because while the _IP_ fragmentation is not that
useful to us, it's still a nice idea we can reuse for our own purpose: we can do the fragmentation at the level
of our application. That's what we will do on the next page.
