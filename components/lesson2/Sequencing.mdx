As we have seen on the previous page, while we have successfully sent a picture to our friend Alice,
she gets it in a scrambled form.

This happens because there is no guarantee that messages sent over the network will be received in the same order they were sent.
This is called _packet reordering_ and it can happen due to a number of reasons&mdash;for example, because network packets are
sent through different routes for efficiency, or because network equipment processes them in a parallel manner.

<OutOfOrderDeliveryPlayground />

The solution to this problem is to include a packet number in the beginning of a message. This way, Alice will know how she
needs to reorder the received sequences of bytes in order to reconstruct the original picture.

<SortingChunks />

With Rust, we can do this by using an iterator function called [`enumerate`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.enumerate),
which gives us an index number for each iteration. Let's see how it works:

<EnumerateChunksPlayground />

Now you can see how each chunk is indexed.
On the receiving end, we can restore the original order of packets by using the iterator function [`sort_by`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort_by):

<ReorderChunksPlayground />

Let's put all these techniques together to finally send Alice an image file in multiple sequenced parts:

<SendOrderedChunksPlayground />

Congratulations, you have finished the second lesson in the TCP/IP series!

In the next one, we will learn how to deal with unreliable networks. In real-world networks, not all packets we
send are guaranteed to be delivered, so we need to make sure that the receiver gets a complete message.
We will learn how we can find out which packets were not delivered and how to retransmit them.
