We have now seen how IP addresses are used in a small, imaginary network of two computers.
But just knowing an address isn’t enough to do something useful: machines need to follow a well-known
protocol to make sure they can communicate with each other in a predictable way. This is what the
Internet protocol suite, also known as [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite),
is about: it's a standard collection of protocols used on the Internet.

The protocol suite consists of several protocols, of which we are interested in two: IP and UDP (later
we will also cover TCP and other protocols).

&#8203;<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> is the bread and butter of networking.
It serves as a foundation for high-level protocols. When computers exchange
messages, they encode them into IP _packets_, which you can view as individual
message units of up to 65 kilobytes in size. Usually, the operating system takes
care of the encoding for us and we don't need to do it manually, but it's still
good to know how it works under the hood, so let's see what a typical IP packet
looks like:

<Playground id="ipPackets" codeWrapperFn={wrapIpHeaderCode}>
  <IpPacketsVis />
</Playground>

When you run this code, you see the destructured IP packet in a table. Each table cell contains an
individial field of the packet header. The header fields we set in code are highlighted in green—we
can skip the rest of them, for now.

On the right side, you can see the exact same packet represented in the
[_hexadecimal_](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) numerical system which is often used
to represent bytes because of its compactness (each single byte can be encoded by a hexadecimal
number ranging from `0x00` to `0xFF`, which [corresponds to decimal](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=0xFF+in+decimal&t=hk&ia=answer)
`0` to `255`). This demonstrates that the IP header is just a sequence of numbers that we can interpret
and represent in different ways.

## User Datagram Protocol

&#8203;<abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr>, or User Datagram Protocol, is a
thin layer above IP which adds some more contextual information for a message. A
UDP <abbr title="a word combination of data + telegram">datagram</abbr>
is also divided into a header and a payload. The fun thing about it is that an
entire UDP datagram is the _payload_ of an IP packet! This is called
_encapsulation_ and it's one of the core ideas in networking. A single layer of
the network stack like IP doesn’t know and doesn’t care about its payload, which
can be a protocol from the Internet protocol suite like TCP and UDP or even a
protocol defined by you.

UDP headers are only 8 bytes long. They contain source and destination _port numbers_ which help to identify
different services running on the same computer—it's very common for a server to have many functions. Usually,
we designate a specific port number for a given service by convention. For example, name servers commonly use
the port number 53.

A UDP header also includes the total size of a datagram in bytes and a _checksum_ which is used to verify
that the original network packet is not corrupted during transmission. And that's all it adds to the IP header!

Let's construct a UDP datagram header and add it to the previous example:

<Playground id="udpDatagram" codeWrapperFn={wrapUdpHeaderCode}>
  <UdpDatagramVis />
</Playground>

Now we are ready to move onto sending messages we have constructed
over the network!
